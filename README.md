# Techno-Hackathon-23
### The choice for the Techno-Hackathon 23:
>Object damage analysis is a computer vision project that aims to detect and identify damage on objects from images or videos using deep learning and image processing techniques. The application will take an image or video as input and use object detection algorithms to identify the object of interest. Then, it will compare the detected object with similar object images to determine whether any damage is present.

```
To implement this project, We will use the following APIs and libraries:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Streamlit
```
```
Concepts used in this project:
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Adaptive Learning 
- Image Processing
- Video Processing
- object detection
```
### Our Proposal:
`Object damage analysis using Adaptive Convoltional Neural Networks`

## Intuition:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated their capacity to achieve state of the art accuracy in image classification, segmentation, object detection and so on. However, CNNs are not robust to image variations such as lighting, rotation, scale, and so on. This is because CNNs are trained on a fixed set of images and are not adaptive to new images. In this project, we will use an adaptive CNN to detect and identify damage on objects from images or videos. The adaptive CNN will be trained on a set of images and will be able to detect and identify damage on objects from new images or videos.

In short, we will be introducing Adaptive kernels for the convolutional layers, motivated by the non-linear nature of the convolution operation. The adaptive kernels will be trained to adapt to the image variations and will be able to detect and identify damage on objects from new images or videos.

Later a simple Website will be created on top of the model in order to make it more user friendly.

*Future works:* "Later we will be using the same model to detect and identify damage on objects from videos, In order to make it more robust and accurate."

*Additional works:* "The model then can be made optimized for embedded systems like the raspberry pi and can be used in real time applications."

## Concepts used in this project:
- Feed forward neural networks
  - Feed forward neural networks are the state of the art neural network models which are inspired by the biological neuron.

- Convolutional Neural Networks
    - Convoltuion neural networks are a type of neural networks that are used to classify images. They are used in image classification, object detection, image segmentation, etc. They are used in many applications like self driving cars, face recognition, etc.
    - They're inspired by the way the human brain works. The human brain has a visual cortex that is responsible for processing visual information. The visual cortex is composed of simple cells and complex cells. The simple cells respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field. The complex cells respond to stimuli over a larger region of the visual field. The complex cells are formed by combining the outputs of simple cells that have similar receptive fields.

- Adaptive Learning
  - Adaptive learning is an intelligent learning system that adapts to the learner's needs and abilities.  
  - Through a variety of techniques, adaptive learning systems can provide a personalized learning experience for each student.
- Adaptive Kernels
  - An Adaptive kernel is a dynamic kernel that changes its weights by itself depending on the input image.
  - An adaptive kernel can be viewed as an array of traditional kernels, for example, a 3x3 kernel can be viewed as a 3x3x3 array of 3x3 kernels. The adaptive kernel will be trained to adapt to the image variations and will be able to detect and identify damage on objects from new images or videos.
- Adaptive Convolutional Neural Networks
  - Adaptive Convolutional Neural Networks are convolutional neural networks that use adaptive kernels.
