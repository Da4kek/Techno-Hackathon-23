# Techno-Hackathon-23
### Our proposal for the Techno-Hackathon 23:
```
Object damage analysis is a computer vision project that aims to detect and identify damage on objects from images or videos using deep learning and image processing techniques. The application will take an image or video as input and use object detection algorithms to identify the object of interest. Then, it will compare the detected object with similar object images to determine whether any damage is present.
```
```
To implement this project, We will use the following APIs and libraries:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Streamlit
```
```
Concepts used in this project:
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Adaptive Learning 
- Image Processing
- Video Processing
- object detection
